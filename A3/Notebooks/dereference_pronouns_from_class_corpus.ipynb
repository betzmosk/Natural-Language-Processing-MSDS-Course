It 's set in someone 's zany idea of a future totalitarian state where guys in black leather are burning all the poetry but have n't gotten around to picking up the machine guns yet . As Keanu Reeves might say , whoa ! Boasting a handsome if over-digitized production and a bevy of male beauties as central characters ( there 's a big cheekbone thing going on here ) , the movie has evolved at least one degree from the dystopian broodings of Orwell . That is , its central conceit is based on antidepressants that were n't around in Orwell 's day . In this future , it is law that every day in every way , every citizen must take an injection of the drug Prozium , which reduces humankind to an efficient if narcoticized half-life . In exchange for this miasma of stupor , the folks do enjoy freedom from crime , aggression , jealousy and all those other messy attributes of what is called the Human Condition . But writer-director Kurt Wimmer takes this intriguing idea a little too far and ventures off into Cloud Cuckooland : Since art stirs feelings , art ( including poetry , drama and mein gott ! movie criticism ) is banned . Thus the reigning stud-pups of this future are an elite security cult , called Clerics . In obedience to `` Father '' ( the movie 's dim-bulb simulation of Orwell 's horrifying Big Brother ) they raid underground crypts and out-of-the-way apartments where heavily armed dissenters still bliss out on the Mona Lisa and Andy Warhol 's soup cans and the poetry of noted revolutionary Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . The plot proper turns on the adventures of Cleric John Preston ( Christian Bale , cheekbone rating 9.8 ) , who is a kind of mythically effective killing machine charged with blowing away Gerard Manley Hopkins readers with AK-47s .

The movie 'Equilibrium' is set in someone's zany idea of a future totalitarian state where guys in black leather are burning all the poetry but haven't gotten around to picking up the machine guns yet. As Keanu Reeves might say, whoa! Boasting a handsome if over-digitized production and a bevy of male beauties as central characters (there's a big cheekbone thing going on here), the movie 'Equilibrium' has evolved at least one degree from the dystopian broodings of Orwell. The central conceit of 'Equilibrium' is based on antidepressants that weren't around in Orwell's day. In this future, the central conceit of 'Equilibrium' (taking the place of 'it') is law that every day in every way, every citizen must take an injection of the drug Prozium, which reduces humankind to an efficient if narcoticized half-life. In exchange for this miasma of stupor, the folks do enjoy freedom from crime, aggression, jealousy, and all those other messy attributes of what is called the Human Condition. But writer-director Kurt Wimmer takes this intriguing idea a little too far and ventures off into Cloud Cuckooland: Since art stirs feelings, art (including poetry, drama, and mein gott! movie criticism) is banned. Thus, the reigning stud-pups of this future are an elite security cult, called Clerics. In obedience to 'Father' (the movie's dim-bulb simulation of Orwell's horrifying Big Brother) they raid underground crypts and out-of-the-way apartments where heavily armed dissenters still bliss out on the Mona Lisa and Andy Warhol's soup cans and the poetry of noted revolutionary Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The plot proper of 'Equilibrium' turns on the adventures of Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale, cheekbone rating 9.8), who is a kind of mythically effective killing machine charged with blowing away Gerard Manley Hopkins readers with AK-47s. He's so efficient that he turned in his own wife for elimination, having detected certain deviant fondnesses for, I don't know, Hermann Hesse or something. But one night, after an especially hectic day of rat-tat-tatting perverts and art mavens, John Preston forgets to take his Prozium and those horrible messy tidal waves called emotions guilt, love, pain, regret, sentimentality come over him.

This new martial art (it looks like John Woo gunfights on overdrive) is employed by special agents of the government appropriately called \"clerics\" (they wear long black cloaks similar to those of Keanu Reaves in The Matrix Reloaded). These \"clerics\" not only hunt and kill off opponents of the government but also destroy anything that might elicit any human emotions, cultural artifacts such as Da Vinci paintings, W.B. Yeats poetry collections, Beethoven recordings, tax returns (I just made that last one up, I suppose they still get those). One of these \"clerics\" (Bale, now all buffed up after American Psycho and ready to don the action hero mantle left behind by Arnold Schwarzenegger now that he is pursuing a political career) stops taking his medication and soon finds himself in conflict with the same regime which he has been so zealously defending his whole life. As viewers might have guessed by now, Equilibrium isn't particularly original.\n","\n","INPUT:  `` Equilibrium '' would be a mindless action picture , except that it has a mind .

'Equilibrium' doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, 'Equilibrium' does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems. Dictatorships of both the left and right are frightened by the idea of their citizens thinking too much, or having too much fun. 'Equilibrium' deals with this notion in the most effective way, by burying freedom of opinion in the story and almost drowning freedom of opinion with entertainment.

'Equilibrium' is set in the 21st century -- hey! that's our century! -- at a time after the Third World War.

To assure world peace and the survival of the human race, everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium, a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side. (Hint: The working title of 'Equilibrium' was 'Librium.') In 'Equilibrium', enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders. The mandate to murder Sense Offenders is a rich irony, since True Believers, not Free Thinkers, are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs. If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology, you are going about God's work in your way, not God's way. Christian Bale stars in 'Equilibrium' as Cleric John Preston, partnered with Partridge (Sean Bean) as a top-level enforcer. Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Christian Bale, and Christian Bale proves it here after Christian Bale's own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses. \"What did Christian Bale feel?\" Christian Bale is asked. \"Christian Bale didn't feel anything,\" Christian Bale replies, and we believe Christian Bale, although perhaps this provides a clue about Christian Bale's wife's need to Offend. John Preston is a top operative, but John Preston is hiding something. We see John Preston pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B. Yeats, a notorious Sense Offender. John Preston has kept the book, John Preston explains, to better understand the enemy (the same reason censors have historically needed to study pornography). John Preston's duties bring John Preston into contact with Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and John Preston feels -- well, it doesn't matter what John Preston feels.\n","\n","INPUT:  In the first years of the 21st century , a third World War broke out .

The elite soldiers of the Grammaton Cleric have only one purpose: to eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man, which is man's ability to feel emotions. Into this story walks John Preston (Christian Bale), a first-class cleric. He is tasked with wiping out yet another stronghold of emotion and creativity, a stash house that contains music, art, books, and various trinkets that reflect the remnants of traditional human society. In a rather unintentionally comical moment, Preston stares down the recovered painting of the Mona Lisa before ordering the painting to be burned. In this peaceful yet bleak future, any item that might spark feelings is dubbed EC-10 or \"sense offense\" material, which warrants immediate destruction. A drug called Prozium is administered to citizens at regular intervals (mandated by alarm bells sounded off in the city centers and available at Equilibrium buildings), and it helps suppress emotions on a personal and chemical basis.
