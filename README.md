## Overview

This repository contains the completed assignments and final project submitted as part of the graduate-level course *Natural Language Processing (MSDS453)*. Each subdirectory corresponds to a major assignment or project and showcases a variety of NLP tasks, including text preprocessing, vectorization, topic modeling, classification, clustering, knowledge graph construction, and chatbot development.

All experiments were conducted in Python using open-source libraries such as `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `gensim`, `spacy`, `tensorflow`, and `openai`.

## Repository Structure

### [`A1/`](./A1)

**Title**: *Data Wrangling and Vectorization Techniques for NLP Clustering*  
Explores different preprocessing pipelines and vectorization methods (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec) on a custom movie review corpus to improve document clustering performance.
